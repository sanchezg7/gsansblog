# Getting Started with React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Let's explore its key features and why it's so widely used.

## What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components".

## Key Concepts

### 1. Components
Components are the building blocks of any React application. A component is a self-contained module that renders some output.

### 2. JSX
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files.

### 3. Props
Props are how components communicate with each other. They allow you to pass data from parent to child components.

## Getting Started

To create a new React project, you can use Create React App or Next.js:

```jsx
// Example of a simple React component
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```
